# Plant Disease Detection using Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)

This project implements a Plant Disease Detection system using a
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) trained on an image-based dataset.

Due to the large size of the dataset (~1.3GB), it is not included in this repository.
A pre-trained model is provided for quick testing and evaluation.

## Dataset
Kaggle Plant Disease Detection Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdhemel/plant-disease-detection/data

## Files Included
- `Plant_Disease_FNN.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full code
- `plant_disease_fnn.keras` – Pre-trained model
- `requirements.txt` – Required dependencies
- `report.pdf` – Project report

## How to Run
### Option 1: Run using pre-trained model (Recommended)
1. Install dependencies:
2. Open the notebook
3. Load the pre-trained model (already mentioned in code)
4. Run evaluation cells (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

### Option 2: Train from scratch
1. Download dataset from Kaggle
2. Update dataset path in the notebook
3. Run all cells to train the model

## Notes
- Dataset is intentionally excluded due to size limitations
- The project focuses on understanding FNNs for image classification
